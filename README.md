# Magic Images Minify CLI üåà
![Screencapture magicImagesMinifyCLI](demo.gif)
### What is this?
This is a light magical tool/script, just by injecting the script file in any folder it will automagically search for images and minify it in a build folder with the same hierarchy.
### Why I made this?
For the glory of satan of course. üòà
### How it works?
It's made with the holy node.js ‚ù§Ô∏è, uses imagemin, glob and fs for finding/managing/minifying images files.
### How can I use it?
I thought you'd never ask.
#### Npm Global
```
npm install -g magic-images-minify
```
#### Yarn
```
yarn global add magic-images-minify
```
Then just by running `mic` or `magic-images-minify` in command line.

#### Manually
- First by cloning the repesitory and copying the files in the same directory it contains images.
```
git clone https://github.com/TareqElMasri/magicImagesMinifyCLI
cp magicImagesMinifyCLI/minify.js magicImagesMinifyCLI/package.json /path/to/directory
```
- Second by installing the dependencies using npm or yarn
```
npm install # OR yarn
```
- Finally by running the script
```
npm start
```

Have a good and progressive day!
